> [!NOTE]
> The transition from the previous GitHub Enterprise organization to this one is still ongoing. The last year's worth of repositories have been copied over here. The GitHub Enterprise organization can still be accessed [here](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/Resistance-Racing).

things to cover in this document

- how the organization and repositories should be structured (and just how to use the github org in general)
- things relevant to all teams writing code like repository naming conventions, README titles, how to list relevant people, etc
- subteam-specific things, like the parts of an API that need to get documented in a data A&A repo or specific requirements/recommendations (images/gifs/videos?)

things to cover in this document

- how the organization and repositories should be structured (and just how to use the github org in general)
- things relevant to all teams writing code like repository naming conventions, README titles, how to list relevant people, etc
- subteam-specific things, like the parts of an API that need to get documented in a data A&A repo or specific requirements/recommendations (images/gifs/videos?)

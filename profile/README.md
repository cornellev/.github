> The transition from the previous GitHub Enterprise organization to this one is still ongoing. The last year's worth of repositories have been copied over here, and active ones pinned. The GitHub Enterprise organization can be accessed [here](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/Resistance-Racing) (sign in with Cornell NetID; ask a software lead if you need access).

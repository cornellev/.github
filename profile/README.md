## About Us

Cornell Electric Vehicles has a history of working on the bleeding edge of the automotive industry. Founded in 2014, we've been pushing the limits of electric power starting before it went mainstream, and we've recently branched into autonomous driving as well.

As a team, we participate in the [Shell Eco Marathon](https://www.shellecomarathon.com/) Americas and Autonomous Programming Competitions, having previously placed highly in both. This GitHub organization has the source code of a variety of projects across the [autonomy](https://www.cornellelectricvehicles.org/software), [electrical](https://www.cornellelectricvehicles.org/electrical), and [data apps and analysis](https://www.cornellelectricvehicles.org/software) subteams.

## For Team Members

> The transition from the previous GitHub Enterprise organization to this one is still ongoing. The last year's worth of repositories have been copied over here. The GitHub Enterprise organization can still be accessed [here](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/Resistance-Racing).
